 # D2 Exotic Catalyst Browser
The D2 Exotic Catalyst Browser is a simple Vue.js web application driven off a JSON file.

This is just a pet project right now mainly to play around with Vue. I'd highly recommend Destiny Set's Catalyst viewer for the most accurate representation and tracking of catalysts. https://destinysets.com/catalysts
